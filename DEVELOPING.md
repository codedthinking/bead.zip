# BEAD Development Overview

## Project Status

BEAD (data dependency management tool) is currently in **mature development** phase, having successfully transitioned from internal research tool to established open-source project. The project has been used in production for several years managing hundreds of data dependencies across multiple research projects.

### Current Version
- **Phase**: Stable Release
- **Users**: Research groups and individual researchers worldwide
- **Data Objects**: Thousands of BEADs in production across institutions
- **Public Release**: Successfully launched in late 2024

## What is BEAD?

BEAD is a data dependency management tool designed for research workflows, particularly in economics and social sciences. It manages versioned data inputs across research projects, ensuring reproducibility and efficient collaboration.

### Core Features
- **Data Versioning**: Automatic timestamping and content-based identification
- **Dependency Tracking**: Maintains directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of data dependencies  
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Simple Storage**: Uses zip files in directories (Bead Boxes) for easy backup and transfer
- **Update Management**: Hybrid automatic and manual update strategies for data inputs
- **Multi-version Support**: Advanced branching and comparison workflows

### Key Components
- **Bead Box**: Storage containers (local, networked, cloud)
- **BEAD Meta**: Dependency and versioning metadata
- **Hybrid Reference System**: Both name-based and UUID-based references
- **CLI + Web Interface**: Command-line and browser-based tools
- **Plugin System**: Extensible integration framework

## Major Technical Decisions

### Implemented
1. **Hybrid Storage Model**: Zip files with optional cloud backends
2. **Dual Referencing**: Name-based (default) + UUID-based (advanced) references
3. **Optional Indexing**: Performance optimization for large Bead Boxes
4. **Cross-platform Priority**: Verified compatibility across all major platforms
5. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for tool integrations

### Current Focus
1. **Cloud Integration**: Native support for major cloud providers
2. **Performance Scaling**: Optimization for very large datasets
3. **Security Enhancements**: Enterprise-grade access controls
4. **Workflow Automation**: Advanced pipeline management

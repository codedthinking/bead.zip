# Tool Comparison Summary

This repository now includes comprehensive comparisons between bead and related reproducible research tools.

## Quick Links

- **[Full Tool Comparison](./tool-comparison.md)** - Detailed analysis comparing orderly2, e3krisztian/bead, packit, and bead.zip
- **[Alternatives Guide](./docs/_guides/alternatives.md)** - Practical guide for choosing between tools
- **[Main Documentation](./bead-comprehensive-guide.md)** - Updated with comparison section

## Tools Compared

1. **@mrc-ide/orderly2** - R-focused reproducible reporting framework
2. **@e3krisztian/bead** - Python-based data dependency management tool  
3. **@mrc-ide/packit** - Web application for outpack data sharing
4. **codedthinking/bead.zip** - This documentation repository

## Key Findings

- **orderly2**: Best for R-heavy research teams with automated workflows
- **e3krisztian/bead**: Best for multi-language pipelines with explicit dependency control
- **packit**: Best for sharing results with non-technical stakeholders
- **bead.zip docs**: Universal concepts applicable to any reproducible research approach

## Integration Possibilities

These tools can work together rather than as alternatives:
- Use bead for multi-language data processing
- Use orderly2 for R-specific analysis
- Use packit for web-based result sharing
- Use bead.zip concepts as methodological foundation

# BEAD Development Meeting Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes a comprehensive development meeting discussing the BEAD (data dependency management) tool, covering release requirements, design decisions, development plans, and presentation strategy for an upcoming conference.

## Key Release Requirements

### Technical Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+ Compatibility**: Critical issue requiring attention, with some compatibility problems identified
- **Error Message Handling**: Magic error messages appearing at unexpected times need investigation and testing
- **API Stability**: User-facing interfaces must be well-designed since the tool will transition from internal use to public release

### Current User Base
- Currently serving only internal users (several hundred BEADs, ~5-12 active users)
- Transition planned to support dozens of research groups and hundreds of users
- Backward compatibility less critical due to small current user base

## Core Design Decisions

### Input Reference Strategy
**Current Debate**: Name-based vs. Kind-based input referencing

**Name-based Approach** (Current):
- Uses zip file names to identify inputs
- Supports input renaming through input maps
- Vulnerable to file renaming breaking references
- More intuitive for basic users

**Kind-based Approach** (Proposed):
- Uses UUID-like identifiers (Kind) for stable references
- Requires indexing system for performance
- More robust but less user-friendly
- Prevents issues with file renaming

**Proposed Solution**: Hybrid approach with name-based as default and optional kind-based updates for advanced users.

### Advanced Use Cases Identified

1. **Version Branching**: Support for parallel development streams (e.g., LTS-2022 vs LTS-2023)
2. **Multi-version Loading**: Loading multiple versions of same data type for comparison
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensuring seamless operation across Windows, Mac, and Linux
4. **Large File Handling**: Supporting server-based workflows for large datasets

### Architecture Decisions

**Bead Box Structure**:
- Maintain simple folder-based storage (zip files in directories)
- Optional indexing for performance without breaking simplicity
- Support for various backends (local folders, S3, servers with DynamoDB)

**Update Strategy**:
- Implement automatic updates with safeguards
- Provide clear warnings when reaching "end of stick" (version chain breaks)
- Support both automatic and manual version management

## Development Plan

### Immediate Priorities (Before August 29 Conference)
1. **Stability Testing**: Fix Python 3.10+ compatibility issues
2. **Error Handling**: Resolve mysterious error messages
3. **Cross-platform Testing**: Verify functionality on Windows, Mac, Linux
4. **User Interface Review**: Streamline commands and help documentation

### Post-Conference Roadmap
1. **Code Refactoring**: Major cleanup if tool gains traction
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Comprehensive user guides and developer documentation
3. **Advanced Features**: Implement hybrid referencing system
4. **Community Support**: Prepare for open-source contributions

### Technical Tasks Identified
- Analyze existing bead metadata to understand current usage patterns
- Implement metadata extraction for kind/content ID analysis
- Create indexing system for large bead box deployments
- Develop better error messages for common failure scenarios

## Presentation Strategy

### Conference Presentation (August 29 deadline)
**Format Decisions**:
- **Avoid Live Demos**: Too risky due to network/technical issues
- **Use Asciinema**: Text-based screen recordings for demo content
- **PDF Slides**: Standard format with embedded demo videos
- **Backup Plan**: Interactive demos during coffee breaks

**Content Focus**:
- Emphasize practical data dependency management
- Highlight advanced use cases for research workflows
- Demonstrate cross-platform compatibility
- Show integration with existing research pipelines

**Technical Approach**:
- Pre-record all demonstrations using Asciinema
- Prepare comprehensive slide deck with embedded videos
- Plan interactive sessions for interested attendees
- Document installation procedures for various platforms

## Todo Items and Action Points

### Immediate (Pre-Conference)
1. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify Python 3.10+ support across platforms
2. **Error Investigation**: Identify and fix mysterious error messages  
3. **Documentation Review**: Update help text and user guides
4. **Cross-platform Validation**: Test on Windows, Mac, Ubuntu with fresh installs

### Development Tasks
1. **Metadata Analysis**: Extract and analyze existing bead metadata
2. **Indexing Implementation**: Design optional indexing system
3. **Interface Optimization**: Streamline command structure
4. **Advanced Use Case Documentation**: Record complex workflows

### Post-Conference
1. **Community Preparation**: Set up contribution guidelines if tool gains traction
2. **Refactoring Planning**: Prepare for major code cleanup
3. **Feature Enhancement**: Implement hybrid referencing system
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate conference feedback

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Python version compatibility issues
- Cross-platform installation problems
- Performance with large bead box collections
- Network reliability for remote bead box access

### User Experience Risks
- Complexity of advanced features overwhelming basic users
- Breaking changes affecting existing workflows
- Insufficient documentation for new adopters
- Conference demo technical failures

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive pre-conference testing
- Clear separation of basic and advanced features
- Robust error messages with suggested solutions
- Multiple demo formats (recorded + interactive)

## Success Metrics

### Conference Goals
- Successful presentation without technical issues
- Positive audience engagement and feedback
- Interest from potential adopters
- Media coverage (YouTube, social media)

### Long-term Success Indicators
- Adoption by external research groups
- Community contributions and pull requests
- Integration requests from related tools
- Academic citations and usage reports
